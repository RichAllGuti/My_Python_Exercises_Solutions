- Find the area of a polygon for a given 'n'.

- Determine whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.

- Provided array of strings, return another array with all of its longest strings.

- Find the number of common characters between them.

- Given a ticket number n, determine if it's lucky or not with True or False output.

- From a string find out if its characters can be rearranged to form a palindrome.

- Provided an array of integers, find the maximal absolute difference between any two of its adjacent elements.
  
- From an input string, find out if it satisfies the IPv4 address naming rules.

- Given an integer number determine if all digits of it are even.

- Validate if the given string is a correct variable name.
  
- Replace each of its characters by the next one in the English alphabet; i.e. 
replace 'a' with 'b', replace 'b' with c, etc.
